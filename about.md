I'm an Instructor of Biomedical Informatics at Vanderbilt.
Despite the title, my primary responsibility is research.
I'm broadly interested in quantifying, modeling, and understanding dynamics and variability in biological systems related to human health and disease.
My goal is to do excellent science and to communicate it clearly.
That's hard, especially the latter.
Fortunately, I've been surrounded by great scientists, communicators, and mentors at every stage of my career.
I even have one at home ([pilot](http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/root/vumc.php?site=vmcpathology&doc=46724&facultyid=133675&mi=true)).

The design of this site was inspired by [wilkelab.org](http://wilkelab.org) and [eisenlab.org](http://eisenlab.org).
If anything about the site or the science appeals to you, please let me know!
